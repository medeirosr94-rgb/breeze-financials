Updated Prompt for Designer/Developer
Goal: Design a high-converting front-end landing page for Breeze Financials, focusing on trust and lead generation (free bookkeeping audit), but also introducing and selling the true value: Fractional CFO services for small businesses. Reference Breeze’s green/white branding, rounded elements, and minimalist style as seen on the current PDF/webpage.

Key Elements:

1. Header/Nav:

Breeze Financials logo (left), links: Home, Why Breeze, Bookkeeping, Fractional CFO, About, Contact.

Sticky and clean.

2. Hero Section:

Headline: “Start with a Free Bookkeeping Audit. Unlock CFO-Level Insights.”

Subhead: “Get a personalized review from a finance expert and see how a Fractional CFO can transform your business.”

Simple lead form (Name, Email, Business Name) with bold CTA: “Request Your Free Audit”

Soft green/white wave or breeze background, calm and trustworthy feel.

3. Social Proof & Trust:

“Trusted by Toronto small businesses”

Google Reviews, testimonials, association logos, etc.

Quick FAQ or “No obligation. 100% confidential.”

4. Value Ladder Section (Bookkeeping → CFO):

Two visually distinct cards/sections:

Bookkeeping: “Never worry about receipts or reconciliations again.”

Fractional CFO: “Go beyond bookkeeping — get real financial strategy, forecasting, and business insight at a fraction of the cost.”

Side-by-side or stacked for mobile.

5. Benefits/Features of Fractional CFO:

Clean, icon-based list:

Strategic cash flow planning

Monthly financial reviews

Forecasting & scenario analysis

Real-time business performance dashboards

Expert guidance, on call

6. Process / How It Works:

3 easy steps:

Request your free audit

Meet your expert (Zoom or in-person)

Get your audit + discover what Fractional CFO can do for you

7. Testimonials & Results:

Real reviews or placeholder with “We saved $X, got clarity on our business, and now we can finally sleep at night.”

Include business owner names/photos if possible.

8. About/Meet Your CFO:

Short bio with headshot (“Hi, I’m Rodrigo — your future CFO. 10+ years in finance, here to help your business grow.”)

9. Sticky/Floating CTA:

“Request Free Audit” button always visible as you scroll.

10. Footer:

Contact info, socials, privacy, “Proudly serving Toronto and beyond.”

Design Guidance:

Use green as the accent color, plenty of whitespace, round and soft edges.

Light, readable fonts with clear headings and sections.

Use subtle breeze/wave motifs, nothing corporate or harsh.

Extra trust ideas:

Data privacy badge (“Your information is secure.”)

Option to book a quick intro call (“Got questions? Let’s talk!”)

Deliver as a React/Tailwind (or similar) page. Content blocks should be easy to swap out or edit.

Make sure the flow is: free audit → “see what a CFO can do for you” → easy signup/contact.
